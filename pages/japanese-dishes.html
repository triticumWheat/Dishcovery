                    Japanese cuisine, known as washoku, 
                    is a traditional style of cooking that emphasizes seasonal ingredients, 
                    balance, and presentation. Rooted in centuries of culture and history, 
                    washoku reflects Japanâ€™s deep respect for nature and harmony. 
                    Common dishes such as sushi, tempura, and miso soup showcase simple flavors and fresh ingredients. 
                    Recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, 
                    Japanese cuisine is not only about taste but also about aesthetics, nutrition, and social connection.

                    Sushi is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes in Japanese cuisine. 
                    It typically consists of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients such as raw or cooked seafood, 
                    vegetables, and sometimes egg. There are many types of sushi, 
                    including nigiri (hand-pressed rice with a topping), 
                    maki (rolled sushi wrapped in seaweed), 
                    and sashimi (sliced raw fish served without rice). 
                    Known for its simplicity and elegance, 
                    sushi highlights the freshness and natural flavor of its ingredients, 
                    making it popular around the world as both a casual and fine dining option.
