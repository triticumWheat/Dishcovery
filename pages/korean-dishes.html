                    <h2>About Korean Dishes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Korean cuisine, known as hansik, is a traditional style of cooking that highlights bold flavors,
                        fermented ingredients, and a harmonious balance of textures. Rooted in centuries of history and
                        Confucian principles, hansik reflects Korea's deep appreciation for seasonality and communal
                        dining.
                        Signature dishes such as kimchi, bibimbap, and bulgogi showcase vibrant flavors and
                        nutrient-rich
                        ingredients. Recognized globally for its health benefits and cultural significance, Korean
                        cuisine
                        is not only about taste but also about tradition, well-being, and shared experiences.

                        <p>
                            Bibimbap is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes in Korean cuisine.
                            It typically consists of warm rice topped with an assortment of saut√©ed vegetables,
                            marinated meat,
                            a fried or raw egg, and a flavorful gochujang (red chili paste) sauce.
                            There are many variations of bibimbap, including dolsot bibimbap (served in a hot stone bowl
                            for a
                            crispy rice texture) and jeonju bibimbap (a renowned regional specialty with a rich
                            history).
                            Known for its vibrant colors and balanced flavors, bibimbap embodies the harmony of Korean
                            cuisine,
                            making it a popular dish both in casual meals and fine dining experiences worldwide.
