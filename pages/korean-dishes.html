                <h2>About Korean Dishes</h2>
                <p>
                    Korean cuisine, known as hansik, is a traditional style of cooking that highlights bold flavors,
                    fermented ingredients, and a harmonious balance of textures. Rooted in centuries of history and
                    Confucian principles, hansik reflects Korea's deep appreciation for seasonality and communal
                    dining.
                    Signature dishes such as kimchi, bibimbap, and bulgogi showcase vibrant flavors and
                    nutrient-rich
                    ingredients. Recognized globally for its health benefits and cultural significance, Korean
                    cuisine
                    is not only about taste but also about tradition, well-being, and shared experiences.
